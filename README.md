# SaveText_API_Rest

an API for saving ciphertext and users, created with NODE (Express) and SQL (MySQL)

### instructions for testing the API:

 1. fill in missing variables in example.env.txt
and don't change the others
 2. import the savetextapi_dump.sql file into MySQL
and remember to put in the DB_NAME variable found in example.env.txt the name you have put in the database
 3. change example.env.txt to .env and open a terminal 
in the root of the project and then write in this terminal:
	 

    npm install
   
  

 4. Once everything you need is installed, run 'npm run test' (without the quotes) in the terminal, and if all the tests pass, you have configured it correctly.
